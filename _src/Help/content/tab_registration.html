				<li>
					<p class="ParagraphTitle"><span class="EntityName">Registered User</span> label</p>
					<p>Displays the name of the User to whom the product is registered.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p class="ParagraphTitle"><span class="EntityName">Backup</span> button</p>

						at a the specified location for quick recovery. This is useful for re-activating the program

						cannot connect to the Internet.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Unregistered Mode</h2>
			<p>
				The Registration tab is the default for all unregistered installations of KO&nbsp;Approach.

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p class="ParagraphTitle"><span class="EntityName">Purchase...</span> button</p>
					<p>
						Opens your web browser and points it to the
						<a class="External" href="http://www.ko-sw.com/Products/Approach/order.aspx" target="_blank">Order page</a>.
						Follow the instructions on the web site to complete the purchasing process.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p class="ParagraphTitle"><span class="EntityName">Restore...</span> button</p>
					<p>
						Allows you to locate and install an <span class="EntityName">Activation Key</span>
						previously issued for the current installation of KO&nbsp;Approach and saved on your hard drive.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p class="ParagraphTitle"><span class="EntityName">Serial Number</span> field</p>
					<p>
						Enter the <span class="EntityName">Serial Number</span> you have received from
						the KO&nbsp;Approach Registration Service. This Number is critical for the Activation
						to succeed.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p class="ParagraphTitle"><span class="EntityName">Activate...</span> button</p>
					<p>
						Contacts the Activation Service and submits the <span class="EntityName">Serial Number</span>
						you have entered for verification. Once the <span class="EntityName">Serial Number</span>
						has been verified, the server issues an <span class="EntityName">Activation Key</span> and
						installs it in your KO&nbsp;Approach application directory. If you encounter an Error message, please
						follow its instructions and try activating the product again. If the problem persists, please
						contact KO&nbsp;Approach Customer Support at <a href="mailto:support@ko-sw.com">support@ko-sw.com.</a>
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p class="ParagraphTitle"><span class="EntityName">Hide Serial Number</span> checkbox</p>
					<p>
						Allows you to hide the <span class="EntityName">Serial Number</span> from others
						while completing the Activation process. Checking this box is optional; it only
						affects the appearance of the <span class="EntityName">Serial Number</span> on
						the screen and does not alter the actual value submitted to the Activation Service.
