			<p>Once you have launched the Uninstaller, you are prompted to follow the instructions on the screens:</p>

			<h2>Step 1 &ndash; Review Program Location</h2>

			<img class="SetupImage" src="../images/uninstall_location.png" alt="Installation location" />
			<p>
				Review the location from which KO&nbsp;Approach is being removed and click
				<span class="EntityName">Next</span> to continue.
			</p>

			<h2>Step 2 &ndash; Remove User-specific Folders</h2>

			<img class="SetupImage" src="../images/uninstall_items.png" alt="Folders stored on a per-users basis" />
			<p>
				The Uninstaller attempts to find all KO&nbsp;Approach directories that
				have been created for the various users of your computer. This information
				is retrieved from the Windows Registry and will not include the directories
				that have been created for those users whose access rights do not allow
				writing to the Registry. Check the box if you wish these items to be removed
				and click <span class="EntityName">Next</span> to continue.
			</p>

			<p class="Warning">
				<strong>ATTENTION!</strong> If you chose to remove the directories listed on the screen,
				please make sure that there is no important data stored in them as this data will be deleted!
				Unless you are positive that you want all items removed, leave the box unchecked.
			</p>

			<h2>Step 3 &ndash; Exit KO&nbsp;Approach</h2>

			<img class="SetupImage" src="../images/uninstall_running.png" alt="Warning displayed when an instance of Approach is running" />
			<p>
				Quit the the running instance of KO&nbsp;Approach by right-clicking the Tray icon and
				choosing <span class="EntityName">Exit</span> from the menu, then click
				<span class="EntityName">Retry</span> to proceed with the uninstallation.
			</p>

			<p class="Note">
				Note: This step only needs to be performed if an instance of
				Approach is currently running.
			</p>

			<h2>Step 4 &ndash; Finish</h2>

			<img class="SetupImage" src="../images/uninstall_finish.png" alt="Uninstallation complete" />
			<p>
				You can optionally click the <span class="EntityName">Show Details</span> button
				to see which files are being removed from your system. Once the process is completed,
				the Uninstaller will display the <span class="EntityName">Uninstallation Complete</span>
				message. Click <span class="EntityName">Finish</span> to exit the Uninstaller.
