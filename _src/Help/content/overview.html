				KO&nbsp;Approach is a desktop Shell Enhancement that enables quicker
				access to files and folders with a set of hierachical menus.
			</p>

			<p>
				KO&nbsp;Approach runs on the background and does not need to be open at all times.
				In fact, unless you need to change some of its settings, you may never know it is there at all!
			</p>

			<p>
				Just click on any folder in Windows Explorer, hold down the mouse key and a menu will appear,
				displaying the contents of the selected folder as a list of items. Highlight folder icons
				to expand sub-menus and move further down your directory structure, or select a file to open it
				in the same the way you do it from the Start menu. It's that simple.
